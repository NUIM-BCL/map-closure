To compile Map-Closure you first need to install Chicken. On Debian do:

# apt-get install chicken-bin

To compile Map-Closure do:

% cd popl2007b/source
% make install

This takes about 25 seconds on an FX-60.

There is a precompiled binary for i686 GNU/Linux in popl2007b/bin
It may run on your platform.

To run the examples do:

% cd popl2007b/examples
% ./run

This takes under a second on an FX-60.
The output we get is in popl2007b/examples/run.text in case you don't care to
run it yourself.
